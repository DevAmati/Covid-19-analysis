# COVID-19 Global Data Tracker

## üìñ Project Overview
This project provides a comprehensive analysis of global COVID-19 data, exploring trends in cases, deaths, and vaccinations across different countries. The analysis is performed using Python and visualized through various plots to gain insights into the pandemic's impact.

---

## üéØ Objectives
1. Analyze global COVID-19 trends in cases, deaths, and vaccinations.
2. Compare COVID-19 statistics across selected countries.
3. Visualize the data to identify patterns and trends.
4. Provide insights into vaccination progress and death rates.

## üöÄ How to Run/View the Project
1. **Prerequisites**:
   - Install Python (version 3.8 or higher).
   - Install the required libraries using the following command:
     ```bash
     pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn
     ```

2. **Dataset**:
   - Download the owid-covid-data.csv dataset from [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths).
   - Place the dataset in the same directory as the notebook or update the file path in the code.

3. **Run the Notebook**:
   - Open the covid-19.ipynb file in Jupyter Notebook or any compatible IDE (e.g., VS Code).
   - Run all cells to execute the analysis and generate visualizations.


## üìä Insights and Reflections
1. **Case Trends**:
   - The analysis reveals variations in COVID-19 case trajectories across different countries.
   - Some countries experienced multiple waves of infections.

2. **Vaccination Progress**:
   - Vaccination rates vary significantly between countries.
   - Countries with higher vaccination rates tend to have lower death rates.

3. **Death Rates**:
   - Comparative analysis highlights variations in COVID-19 mortality rates across countries.
   - Death rates are influenced by factors such as healthcare infrastructure and vaccination coverage.

4. **Limitations**:
   - The analysis is based on publicly available data, which may not reflect the most recent trends.
   - Data quality and reporting methods vary between countries, which may affect the accuracy of the analysis.
